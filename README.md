Watch Dog is a multi-function home used robot. Regarding to the issue of unstable home security, we design a guardian robot for strengthening home safety.
• Scenario 1: Guardian Robot
Suppose that owner is going to sleep at night or take a nap at daily time, so he puts Watch Dog close to the door or in the living room closing to window and switches the mode to guardian mode. If someone unexpected coming in house and pass through the robot, IR sensor will detect and alarm the buzzer immediately, which can attract owner notice right away and avoid danger.
Important Reminder: we should place the robot in not easily recognised area.
After we design the main function, we realise that we should add other function for robot to work at daily time, because it is hard to attract customers to purchase a robot only have one function and only work at night. And house-cleaning function is the best one for our robot.
• Scenario 2: Mopping Floor Robot
During the day, you can use it as a cleaning robot. It has a mop driven by motor on its tail. The motor will rotate and drive the mop rotating. Owner can manipulate the robot by keyboard move around the house and mopping the floor.
Also, regarding to the unpredictable temperature at morning, we add a function that robot can remind users what type of clothes should dress when they wake up, through measuring temperature by temperature sensor.
• Scenario 3: Dressing Advisor
At the morning, temperature sensor measures the temperature and transmits the temperature to the master board where RGB LED located. If the temperature lower than 15 degree, RGB LED lights blue. If the temperature higher than 25 degree, RGB lights red. Normally, RGB light green.
